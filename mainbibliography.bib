title = {An Overview of Overfitting and its Solutions},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Overfitting is a fundamental issue in supervised machine learning which prevents us from perfectly generalizing the models to well fit observed data on training data, as well as unseen data on testing set. Because of the presence of noise, the limited size of training set, and the complexity of classifiers, overfitting happens. This paper is going to talk about overfitting from the perspectives of causes and solutions. To reduce the effects of overfitting, various strategies are proposed to address to these causes: 1) “early-stopping” strategy is introduced to prevent overfitting by stopping training before the performance stops optimize; 2) “network-reduction” strategy is used to exclude the noises in training set; 3) “data-expansion” strategy is proposed for complicated models to fine-tune the hyper-parameters sets with a great amount of data; and 4) “regularization” strategy is proposed to guarantee models performance to a great extent while dealing with real world issues by feature-selection, and by distinguishing more useful and less useful features.}

abstract = {A large variety of problems are multi-labeled, which made the Multi-Label Classification field become an active topic in the machine learning community. However, real world problems tend to be imbalanced, meaning that some classes may have more samples than others. Learning from imbalanced datasets is a challenging task and for that has attracted the attention of researchers that have proposed some resampling algorithms to address this problem. This work presents two main contributions: A new resampling algorithm for multi-label classification problems named MLTL - Multi-Label Tomek Link, which is based on the standard Tomek Link resampling algorithm; A multi-label imbalanceness API for the Mulan framework. Results in seven well-known datasets showed that MLTL is a competitive technique when compared to other multi-label resampling methods from the literature.}

abstract = {The problem of imbalanced data classification often exists in medical diagnosis. Traditional classification algorithms usually assume that the number of samples in each class is similar and their misclassification cost during training is equal. However, the misclassification cost of patient samples is higher than that of healthy person samples. Therefore, how to increase the identification of patients without affecting the classification of healthy individuals is an urgent problem. In order to solve the problem of imbalanced data classification in medical diagnosis, we propose a hybrid sampling algorithm called RFMSE, which combines the Misclassification-oriented Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (M-SMOTE) and Edited nearset neighbor (ENN) based on Random forest (RF). The algorithm is mainly composed of three parts. First, M-SMOTE is used to increase the number of samples in the minority class, while the over-sampling rate of M-SMOTE is the misclassification rate of RF. Then, ENN is used to remove the noise ones from the majority samples. Finally, RF is used to perform classification prediction for the samples after hybrid sampling, and the stopping criterion for iterations is determined according to the changes of the classification index (i.e. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)). When the value of MCC continuously drops, the process of iterations will be stopped. Extensive experiments conducted on ten UCI datasets demonstrate that RFMSE can effectively solve the problem of imbalanced data classification. Compared with traditional algorithms, our method can improve F-value and MCC more effectively.}
